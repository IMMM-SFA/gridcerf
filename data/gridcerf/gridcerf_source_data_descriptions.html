<h2>1. Introduction</h2>

<p>Climate change, energy system transitions, and socioeconomic change are compounding influences affecting the 
growth of electricity demand. While energy efficiency initiatives and distributed resources can address a significant 
amount of this demand, the United States will likely still need new utility-scale generation resources. The energy sector 
uses capacity expansion planning models to determine the aggregate need for new generation, but these models are typically 
at the state or regional scale and are not equipped to address the wide range of location- and technology-specific issues 
that are increasingly a factor in power plant siting. To help address these challenges, we have developed the Geospatial 
Raster Input Data for Capacity Expansion Regional Feasibility (GRIDCERF) data package, a high-resolution product to 
evaluate siting suitability for renewable and non-renewable power plants in the conterminous United States. GRIDCERF 
offers 265 suitability layers for use with 56 power plant technology configurations in a harmonized format that can be 
easily ingested by geospatially-enabled modeling software. It also provides pre-compiled technology-specific suitability 
layers and allows for user customization to robustly address science objectives when evaluating varying future conditions.

<h3>US Bureau of Indian Affairs Surface Management Agency Areas</h3>
<b><u>GRIDCERF Layer Name:</u></b> gridcerf_bia_surface_management_agency_areas.tif
<br>
<b><u>Source Data Title:</u></b>Bureau of Land Management (BLM) National Surface Management Agency (SMA) Area Polygons
<br>
<b><u>Description from Source:</u></b>
The purpose of this dataset is to fulfill the public and Government's need to know what agency is managing Federal land in a given area, and for use by BLM Staff for use in analysis and reports. This dataset is useful as a tool to determine and illustrate the boundaries of a particular Federal agency's "managing" area and to quantify these areas in terms of geographic acreage. The Surface Management Agency (SMA) Geographic Information System (GIS) dataset depicts Federal land for the United States and classifies this land by its active Federal surface managing agency. The SMA feature class covers the continental United States, Alaska, Hawaii, Puerto Rico, Guam, American Samoa and the Virgin Islands. A Federal SMA agency refers to a Federal agency with administrative jurisdiction over the surface of Federal lands. Jurisdiction over the land is defined when the land is either: Withdrawn by some administrative or legislative action, or Acquired or Exchanged by a Federal Agency. This layer is a dynamic assembly of spatial data layers maintained at various federal and local government offices. The GIS data contained in this dataset represents the polygon features that show the boundaries for Surface Management Agency and the surface extent of each Federal agency's surface administrative jurisdiction. SMA data depicts current withdrawn areas for a particular agency and (when appropriate) includes land that was acquired or exchanged and is located outside of a withdrawal area for that agency. The SMA data do not illustrate land status ownership pattern boundaries or contain land ownership attribute details. The SMA Withdrawals feature class covers the continental United States, Alaska, Hawaii, Puerto Rico, Guam, American Samoa and the Virgin Islands. A Federal SMA Withdrawal is defined by formal actions that set aside, withhold, or reserve Federal land by statute or administrative order for public purposes. A withdrawal creates a title encumbrance on the land. Withdrawals must accomplish one or more of the following: A. Transfer total or partial jurisdiction of Federal land between Federal agencies. B. Close (segregate) Federal land to operation of all or some of the public land laws and/or mineral laws. C. Dedicate Federal land to a specific public purpose. There are four major categories of formal withdrawals: (1) Administrative, (2) Presidential Proclamations, (3) Congressional, and (4) Federal Power Act (FPA) or Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) Withdrawals. These SMA Withdrawals will include the present total extent of withdrawn areas rather than all of the individual withdrawal actions that created them over time.

<h3>US Bureau of Land Management National Monuments</h3>
<b><u>GRIDCERF Layer Name:</u></b> gridcerf_blm_nlcs_national_monument_conus.tif
<br>
<b><u>Source Data Title:</u></b> BLM National Landscape Conservation System (NLCS) Wilderness Areas Polygons
<br>
<b><u>Description from Source:</u></b>
This feature class includes Cooperative Management and Protection Areas, Forest Reserves, National Conservation Areas, National Monuments, and Outstanding Natural Areas. Descriptions of each type of polygon found in this feature class can be found on Page 21 of the National Landscape Conservation System (NLCS) Implementation Guidelines (Version 1.1). The Bureau of Land Management's National Conservation Lands include 19 national monuments in nine western states. These national monuments encompass landscapes of tremendous beauty and diversity, ranging from rugged California coastline to vividly-hued desert canyons. The Antiquities Act of 1906 grants the President authority to designate national monuments in order to protect “objects of historic or scientific interest.” National conservation areas (NCAs) and similarly designated lands are designated by Congress to conserve, protect, enhance, and manage public lands for the benefit and enjoyment of present and future generations. The Bureau of Land Management's National Conservation Lands include 16 NCAs and five similarly designated lands in ten states. These lands feature exceptional scientific, cultural, ecological, historical, and recreational values. They differ tremendously in landscape and size, varying from the coastal beauty of California's 18-acre Piedras Blancas Light Station Outstanding Natural Area to the rugged desert vistas of Nevada's 1.2 million acre Black Rock Desert-High Rock Canyon Emigrant Trails NCA.  This polygon feature class represents the spatial extent and boundaries of the BLM National Landscape Conservation System (NLCS) National Monuments, National Conservation Areas and Similar Designations. This dataset is a subset of the official national dataset, containing features and attributes intended for public release and has been optimized for online map service performance. The Implementation Guide represents the official national dataset from which this dataset was derived.

<b><u>Description from Source:</u></b>
The purpose of this dataset is to fulfill the public and Government's need to know what agency is managing Federal land in a given area, and for use by BLM Staff for use in analysis and reports. This dataset is useful as a tool to determine and illustrate the boundaries of a particular Federal agency's "managing" area and to quantify these areas in terms of geographic acreage. The Surface Management Agency (SMA) Geographic Information System (GIS) dataset depicts Federal land for the United States and classifies this land by its active Federal surface managing agency. The SMA feature class covers the continental United States, Alaska, Hawaii, Puerto Rico, Guam, American Samoa and the Virgin Islands. A Federal SMA agency refers to a Federal agency with administrative jurisdiction over the surface of Federal lands. Jurisdiction over the land is defined when the land is either: Withdrawn by some administrative or legislative action, or Acquired or Exchanged by a Federal Agency. This layer is a dynamic assembly of spatial data layers maintained at various federal and local government offices. The GIS data contained in this dataset represents the polygon features that show the boundaries for Surface Management Agency and the surface extent of each Federal agency's surface administrative jurisdiction. SMA data depicts current withdrawn areas for a particular agency and (when appropriate) includes land that was acquired or exchanged and is located outside of a withdrawal area for that agency. The SMA data do not illustrate land status ownership pattern boundaries or contain land ownership attribute details. The SMA Withdrawals feature class covers the continental United States, Alaska, Hawaii, Puerto Rico, Guam, American Samoa and the Virgin Islands. A Federal SMA Withdrawal is defined by formal actions that set aside, withhold, or reserve Federal land by statute or administrative order for public purposes. A withdrawal creates a title encumbrance on the land. Withdrawals must accomplish one or more of the following: A. Transfer total or partial jurisdiction of Federal land between Federal agencies. B. Close (segregate) Federal land to operation of all or some of the public land laws and/or mineral laws. C. Dedicate Federal land to a specific public purpose. There are four major categories of formal withdrawals: (1) Administrative, (2) Presidential Proclamations, (3) Congressional, and (4) Federal Power Act (FPA) or Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) Withdrawals. These SMA Withdrawals will include the present total extent of withdrawn areas rather than all of the individual withdrawal actions that created them over time.
