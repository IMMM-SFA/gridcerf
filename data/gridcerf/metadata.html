    <br> <br><b><u>Source Data 1:</u></b>
        <br><ol><b><u>Source Data Title: </u></b>U.S. Department of Transportation (USDOT) Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS) - Airport Facilities
        <br><b><u>Description from Source: </u></b>The dataset provides users with information about airport locations and attributes and can be used for national and regional analysis applications. The Aviation Facilities dataset is updated every 28 days from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and is part of the U.S. Department of Transportation (USDOT)/Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS) National Transportation Atlas Database (NTAD). The Aviation Facilities dataset is a geographic point database of all official and operational aerodromes in the United States and U.S. Territories. Attribute data is provided on the physical and operational characteristics of the aerodrome, current usage including enplanements and aircraft operations, congestion levels and usage categories. This geospatial data is derived from the FAA's National Airspace System Resource Aeronautical Data Product. For more information about these data, please visit: https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/flight_info/aeronav/Aero_Data/NASR_Subscription.

        <br><ol><b><u>Source Data Title: </u></b>U.S. Department of Transportation (USDOT) Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS) - Runways
        <br><b><u>Description from Source: </u></b>This data provides users with information about the runway locations and attributes for national and regional analysis applications. The Runways dataset is updated every 28 days from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and is part of the U.S. Department of Transportation (USDOT)/Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS) National Transportation Atlas Database (NTAD). The Runways database contains runways in the United States and US territories containing information on the physical characteristics of the runways. This data layer contains runways that have corresponding and reported runways ends, and the linear feature of the runway could be created based off these points. The runways in the dataset are associated with the airports dataset on NTAD, showing runways for all official and operational aerodromes. This geospatial data is derived from the FAA's National Airspace System Resource Aeronautical Data.

    <br> <b><u>GRIDCERF Composite Data Layer Methodology: </u></b> The source data are reprojected to the NAD 1983 Albers contiguous USA (ESRI:102003) coordinate reference system. From source data 1, all airport, heliport, balloonport, and similar areas are excluded from siting for all technologies. For technologies that have facilities with tall components (e.g., wind turbines, CSP towers, plant stacks), an additional area around any airport that has a runway at least 3200 ft long is also excluded, following Federal Aviation Administration DOT, 77.23. Airports that do not meet this criteria receive no additional buffer. Heliports and baloonports do not receive an additional buffer. The buffer amount is determined based on the height of the object where for each additional 100 ft of height over 200ft, an additional 1 nautical mile buffer must be applied past 3 nautical miles.

        <br><b><u>Description from Source: </u></b>This data provides users with information about the runway locations and attributes for national and regional analysis applications. The Runways dataset is updated every 28 days from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and is part of the U.S. Department of Transportation (USDOT)/Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS) National Transportation Atlas Database (NTAD). The Runways database contains runways in the United States and US territories containing information on the physical characteristics of the runways. This data layer contains runways that have corresponding and reported runways ends, and the linear feature of the runway could be created based off these points. The runways in the dataset are associated with the airports dataset on NTAD, showing runways for all official and operational aerodromes. This geospatial data is derived from the FAA's National Airspace System Resource Aeronautical Data.

    <br> <b><u>GRIDCERF Composite Data Layer Methodology: </u></b> The source data are reprojected to the NAD 1983 Albers contiguous USA (ESRI:102003) coordinate reference system. From source data 1, all airport, heliport, balloonport, and similar areas are excluded from siting for all technologies. For technologies that have facilities with tall components (e.g., wind turbines, CSP towers, plant stacks), an additional area around any airport that has a runway at least 3200 ft long is also excluded, following Federal Aviation Administration DOT, 77.23. Airports that do not meet this criteria receive no additional buffer. Heliports and baloonports do not receive an additional buffer. The buffer amount is determined based on the height of the object where for each additional 100 ft of height over 200ft, an additional 1 nautical mile buffer must be applied past 3 nautical miles.

        <br><ol><b><u>Source Data Title: </u></b>Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) Land Area Representations
        <br><b><u>Description from Source: </u></b>The purpose of the American Indian and Alaska Native Land Area Representation (AIAN-LAR) Geographic Information System (GIS) dataset is to depict the external extent of federal Indian reservations and the external extent of associated land held in “trust” by the United States, “restricted fee” or “mixed ownership” status for federally recognized tribes and individual Indians. This dataset includes other land area types such as Public Domain Allotments, Dependent Indian Communities and Homesteads. This GIS Dataset is prepared strictly for illustrative and reference purposes only and should not be used, and is not intended for legal, survey, engineering or navigation purposes. No warranty is made by the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) for the use of the data for purposes not intended by the BIA. This GIS Dataset may contain errors. There is no impact on the legal status of the land areas depicted herein and no impact on land ownership. No legal inference can or should be made from the information in this GIS Dataset. The GIS Dataset is to be used solely for illustrative, reference and statistical purposes and may be used for government to government Tribal consultation. Reservation boundary data is limited in authority to those areas where there has been settled Congressional definition or final judicial interpretation of the boundary. Absent settled Congressional definition or final judicial interpretation of a reservation boundary, the BIA recommends consultation with the appropriate Tribe and then the BIA to obtain interpretations of the reservation boundary. The land areas and their representations are compilations defined by the official land title records of the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) which include treaties, statutes, Acts of Congress, agreements, executive orders, proclamations, deeds and other land title documents. The trust, restricted, and mixed ownership land area shown here, are suitable only for general spatial reference and do not represent the federal government's position on the jurisdictional status of Indian country. Ownership and jurisdictional status is subject to change and must be verified with plat books, patents, and deeds in the appropriate federal and state offices. Included in this dataset are the exterior extent of off reservation trust, restricted fee tracts and mixed tracts of land including Public Domain allotments, Dependent Indian Communities, Homesteads and government administered lands and those set aside for schools and dormitories. There are also land areas where there is more than one tribe having an interest in or authority over a tract of land but this information is not specified in the AIAN-LAR dataset. The dataset includes both surface and subsurface tracts of land (tribal and individually held) “off reservation” tracts and not simply off reservation “allotments” as land has in many cases been subsequently acquired in trust. These data are public information and may be used by various organizations, agencies, units of government (i.e., Federal, state, county, and city), and other entities according to the restrictions on appropriate use. It is strongly recommended that these data be acquired directly from the BIA and not indirectly through some other source, which may have altered or integrated the data for another purpose for which they may not have been intended. Integrating land areas into another dataset and attempting to resolve boundary differences between other entities may produce inaccurate results. It is also strongly recommended that careful attention be paid to the content of the metadata file associated with these data. Users are cautioned that digital enlargement of these data to scales greater than those at which they were originally mapped can cause misinterpretation. The BIA AIAN-LAR dataset's spatial accuracy and attribute information are continuously being updated, improved and is used as the single authoritative land area boundary data for the BIA mission. These data are available through the Bureau of Indian Affairs, Office of Trust Services, Division of Land Titles and Records, Branch of Geospatial Support.

        <br><b><u>Description from Source: </u></b>This polygon feature class shows the spatial extent and boundaries of Areas of Critical Environmental Concern that have become officially designated by the BLM. In general, the ACEC dataset defines areas within the public lands where special management attention is required to protect and prevent irreparable damage to important historic, cultural, or scenic values, fish and wildlife resources or other natural systems or processes, or to protect life and safety from natural hazards. This polygon feature class shows the spatial extent and boundaries of Areas of Critical Environmental Concern that have become officially designated by the BLM. These polygon features were previously in a pre-designated status (i.e. being considered as areas to be eventually designated as official ACEC designated polygons). Once these polygon feature left the Pre-Designated phase (transitioned from a Considered to Designated status), they were removed from the ACEC Pre-designated polygon feature class and placed in this ACEC Designated polygon feature class. This dataset is a subset of the official national dataset, containing features and attributes intended for public release and has been optimized for online map service performance. The Implementation Guide represents the official national dataset from which this dataset was derived.

        <br><b><u>Description from Source: </u></b>This feature class includes Cooperative Management and Protection Areas, Forest Reserves, National Conservation Areas, National Monuments, and Outstanding Natural Areas. Descriptions of each type of polygon found in this feature class can be found on Page 21 of the National Landscape Conservation System (NLCS) Implementation Guidelines (Version 1.1). The Bureau of Land Management's National Conservation Lands include 19 national monuments in nine western states. These national monuments encompass landscapes of tremendous beauty and diversity, ranging from rugged California coastline to vividly-hued desert canyons. The Antiquities Act of 1906 grants the President authority to designate national monuments in order to protect “objects of historic or scientific interest.” National conservation areas (NCAs) and similarly designated lands are designated by Congress to conserve, protect, enhance, and manage public lands for the benefit and enjoyment of present and future generations. The Bureau of Land Management's National Conservation Lands include 16 NCAs and five similarly designated lands in ten states. These lands feature exceptional scientific, cultural, ecological, historical, and recreational values. They differ tremendously in landscape and size, varying from the coastal beauty of California's 18-acre Piedras Blancas Light Station Outstanding Natural Area to the rugged desert vistas of Nevada's 1.2 million acre Black Rock Desert-High Rock Canyon Emigrant Trails NCA. This polygon feature class represents the spatial extent and boundaries of the BLM National Landscape Conservation System (NLCS) National Monuments, National Conservation Areas and Similar Designations. This dataset is a subset of the official national dataset, containing features and attributes intended for public release and has been optimized for online map service performance. The Implementation Guide represents the official national dataset from which this dataset was derived.

        <br><b><u>Description from Source: </u></b>This dataset contains the polygons that define the boundaries of the BLM National Landscape Conservation System (NLCS) Wilderness Areas and Other Related Lands. In June 2000, the BLM responded to growing concern over the loss of open space by creating the National Landscape Conservation System (NLCS). The NLCS brings into a single system some of the BLM's premier designations. The Wilderness Areas, Wilderness Study Areas, and Other Related Lands represent three of these eleven premier designations. By putting these lands into an organized system, the BLM hopes to increase public awareness of these areas' scientific, cultural, educational, ecological and other values. The data standard for these boundaries will assist in the management of all eleven designations within the NLCS. Particularly, NLCS data pertains to the following BLM groups and their purposes: Land Use Planners, GIS Specialists, NLCS team leads, BLM managers, and public stakeholder groups. Feature Class for the BLM Wilderness Areas and BLM Other Related Lands data covered by the National Landscape Conservation System (NLCS) Data Standard. In particular, this feature class includes the polygon features representing the spatial extent and boundaries of the BLM National Landscape Conservation System (NLCS) Wilderness Areas. A Wilderness is a special place where the earth and its community of life are essentially undisturbed; they retain a primeval character, without permanent improvements and generally appear to have been affected primarily by the forces of nature. In 1964, Congress established the National Wilderness Preservation System and designated the first Wilderness Areas in passing the Wilderness Act. The uniquely American idea of wilderness has become an increasingly significant tool to ensure long-term protection of natural landscapes. Wilderness protects the habitat of numerous wildlife species and serves as a biodiversity bank for many species of plants and animals. Wilderness is also a source of clean water. The Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 directed the Bureau to inventory and study its roadless areas for wilderness characteristics. To be designated as a Wilderness Study Area, an area has to have the following characteristics: Size - roadless areas of at least 5,000 acres of public lands or of a manageable size; Naturalness - generally appears to have been affected primarily by the forces of nature; Opportunities - provides outstanding opportunities for solitude or primitive and unconfined types of recreation. In addition, Wilderness Study Areas often have special qualities such as ecological, geological, educational, historical, scientific and scenic values. BLM National Landscape Conservation System (NLCS) Other Related Lands are lands not in Wilderness or Wilderness Study Areas that have been determined to have wilderness character through inventory or land use planning. These lands fall into one of two categories. The first category are lands with "wilderness value and characteristics". These are inventoried areas not in Wilderness or Wilderness Study Areas that have been determined to meet the size, naturalness, and the outstanding solitude and/or the outstanding primitive and unconfined recreation criteria. The second category are "wilderness characteristic protection areas". These are former lands with "wilderness value and characteristics" where a plan decision has been made to protect them. This dataset is a subset of the official national dataset, containing features and attributes intended for public release and has been optimized for online map service performance. The Implementation Guide represents the official national dataset from which this dataset was derived.

        <br><b><u>Description from Source: </u></b>The purpose of this dataset is to fulfill the public and Government's need to know what agency is managing Federal land in a given area, and for use by BLM Staff for use in analysis and reports. This dataset is useful as a tool to determine and illustrate the boundaries of a particular Federal agency's "managing" area and to quantify these areas in terms of geographic acreage. The Surface Management Agency (SMA) Geographic Information System (GIS) dataset depicts Federal land for the United States and classifies this land by its active Federal surface managing agency. The SMA feature class covers the continental United States, Alaska, Hawaii, Puerto Rico, Guam, American Samoa and the Virgin Islands. A Federal SMA agency refers to a Federal agency with administrative jurisdiction over the surface of Federal lands. Jurisdiction over the land is defined when the land is either: Withdrawn by some administrative or legislative action, or Acquired or Exchanged by a Federal Agency. This layer is a dynamic assembly of spatial data layers maintained at various federal and local government offices. The GIS data contained in this dataset represents the polygon features that show the boundaries for Surface Management Agency and the surface extent of each Federal agency's surface administrative jurisdiction. SMA data depicts current withdrawn areas for a particular agency and (when appropriate) includes land that was acquired or exchanged and is located outside of a withdrawal area for that agency. The SMA data do not illustrate land status ownership pattern boundaries or contain land ownership attribute details. The SMA Withdrawals feature class covers the continental United States, Alaska, Hawaii, Puerto Rico, Guam, American Samoa and the Virgin Islands. A Federal SMA Withdrawal is defined by formal actions that set aside, withhold, or reserve Federal land by statute or administrative order for public purposes. A withdrawal creates a title encumbrance on the land. Withdrawals must accomplish one or more of the following: A. Transfer total or partial jurisdiction of Federal land between Federal agencies. B. Close (segregate) Federal land to operation of all or some of the public land laws and/or mineral laws. C. Dedicate Federal land to a specific public purpose. There are four major categories of formal withdrawals: (1) Administrative, (2) Presidential Proclamations, (3) Congressional, and (4) Federal Power Act (FPA) or Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) Withdrawals. These SMA Withdrawals will include the present total extent of withdrawn areas rather than all of the individual withdrawal actions that created them over time. A Federal SMA agency refers to a Federal agency with administrative jurisdiction over the surface of Federal lands. Jurisdiction over the land is defined when the land is either: Withdrawn by some administrative or legislative action, or Acquired or Exchanged by a Federal Agency. This layer is a dynamic assembly of spatial data layers maintained at various federal and local government offices.

    <br> <b><u>GRIDCERF Composite Data Layer Methodology: </u></b> Carbon from CCS technologies is stored in saline reservoirs or a carbon pipeline which transfers it to another storage location. CO2 pipeline infrastructure data is not available publicly, therefore, a proxy suitability layer is created for CO2 pipelines that follows the assumption that they may follow similar paths as existing natural gas pipelines. A 50km buffer around the natural gas pipeline areas in combination with any geospatial area located above a saline reservoir is considered suitable for carbon storage. Both source datasets are reprojected to the NAD 1983 Albers contiguous USA (ESRI:102003) coordinate reference system.

The National Waterway Network (Lines) is a comprehensive network database of the Nation's navigable waterways. The dataset covers the 48 contiguous states plus the District of Columbia, Hawaii, Alaska, Puerto Rico and water links between. It consists of a line feature class of the National Waterway Network (NWN), which is based on a route feature class for the NWN update regions (“1” through “7”, as well as the open ocean region “0”) and route event table with linear referencing system measures for NWN links. This dataset is a feature class with associated measures (in miles) that are used for finding distances, locating features, and displaying route event layers. It was exported from this route event layer. The nominal scale of the dataset varies with the source material. The majority of the information is at 1:100,000 with larger scales used in harbor/bay/port areas and smaller scales used in open waters. These data could be used for analytical studies of waterway performance, for compiling commodity flow statistics, and for mapping purposes.

The EROM table contains other mean annual flow/velocity statistics for the NHDFlowline features such as Flow from runoff or Velocity from runoff. Subject matter experts on this data agreed that for the purposes of finding flow discharge rates of cooling water for power plants, the gauge adjusted vales were the ideal empirical values for this study. It should also be noted that the flow rates were originally in Cubic feet per second (cfs) but converted to Gallons per minute (gpm). The geospatial data sets included in NHDPlusV2 are intended to support a variety of water- related applications. They already have been used in an application to develop estimates of mean annual streamflow and velocity for each NHDFlowline feature in the conterminous United States. The results of these analyses are included with the NHDPlusV2 data. A water-quality model developed by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) called SPARROW (Spatially Referenced Regressions on Watershed Attributes), can utilize the NHDPlusV2 network functionality to track the downstream transport of nutrients, sediments, or other substances. NHDPlusV2 water bodies and estimates of streamflow and velocity are used in SPARROW to identify reservoir retention and in-stream loss factors. NHDPlusV2 climatic and land surface attributes can be used in SPARROW to identify potential factors in the delivery of nutrients from the land surface to streams. NHDPlusV2 data is also being used in select areas for a USGS Web-based application, called StreamStats. StreamStats provides tools to interactively select any point in the implemented areas, delineate watersheds, and to obtain streamflow and watershed characteristics for the selected point. NHDPlusV2 has been designed to accommodate many users' needs for future applications. NHDPlusV2 provides the framework and tools necessary to customize the behavior of the network relationships as well as building upon the attribute database, for which the user can assign their own data to the network.

The EROM table contains other mean annual flow/velocity statistics for the NHDFlowline features such as Flow from runoff or Velocity from runoff. Subject matter experts on this data agreed that for the purposes of finding flow discharge rates of cooling water for power plants, the gauge adjusted vales were the ideal empirical values for this study. It should also be noted that the flow rates were originally in Cubic feet per second (cfs) but converted to Gallons per minute (gpm). The geospatial data sets included in NHDPlusV2 are intended to support a variety of water- related applications. They already have been used in an application to develop estimates of mean annual streamflow and velocity for each NHDFlowline feature in the conterminous United States. The results of these analyses are included with the NHDPlusV2 data. A water-quality model developed by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) called SPARROW (Spatially Referenced Regressions on Watershed Attributes), can utilize the NHDPlusV2 network functionality to track the downstream transport of nutrients, sediments, or other substances. NHDPlusV2 water bodies and estimates of streamflow and velocity are used in SPARROW to identify reservoir retention and in-stream loss factors. NHDPlusV2 climatic and land surface attributes can be used in SPARROW to identify potential factors in the delivery of nutrients from the land surface to streams.

NHDPlusV2 water bodies and estimates of streamflow and velocity are used in SPARROW to identify reservoir retention and in-stream loss factors. NHDPlusV2 climatic and land surface attributes can be used in SPARROW to identify potential factors in the delivery of nutrients from the land surface to streams. NHDPlusV2 data is also being used in select areas for a USGS Web-based application, called StreamStats. StreamStats provides tools to interactively select any point in the implemented areas, delineate watersheds, and to obtain streamflow and watershed characteristics for the selected point. NHDPlusV2 has been designed to accommodate many users' needs for future applications. NHDPlusV2 provides the framework and tools necessary to customize the behavior of the network relationships as well as building upon the attribute database, for which the user can assign their own data to the network.

It should also be noted that the flow rates were originally in Cubic feet per second (cfs) but converted to Gallons per minute (gpm). The geospatial data sets included in NHDPlusV2 are intended to support a variety of water- related applications. They already have been used in an application to develop estimates of mean annual streamflow and velocity for each NHDFlowline feature in the conterminous United States. The results of these analyses are included with the NHDPlusV2 data. A water-quality model developed by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) called SPARROW (Spatially Referenced Regressions on Watershed Attributes), can utilize the NHDPlusV2 network functionality to track the downstream transport of nutrients, sediments, or other substances. NHDPlusV2 water bodies and estimates of streamflow and velocity are used in SPARROW to identify reservoir retention and in-stream loss factors. NHDPlusV2 climatic and land surface attributes can be used in SPARROW to identify potential factors in the delivery of nutrients from the land surface to streams. NHDPlusV2 data is also being used in select areas for a USGS Web-based application, called StreamStats. StreamStats provides tools to interactively select any point in the implemented areas, delineate watersheds, and to obtain streamflow and watershed characteristics for the selected point. NHDPlusV2 has been designed to accommodate many users' needs for future applications. NHDPlusV2 provides the framework and tools necessary to customize the behavior of the network relationships as well as building upon the attribute database, for which the user can assign their own data to the network.

        <br><ol><b><u>Source Data Title: </u></b>National Land Cover Dataset (NLCD) - Wetlands
        <br><b><u>Description from Source: </u></b>The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), in partnership with several federal agencies, has developed and released five National Land Cover Database (NLCD) products over the past two decades: NLCD 1992, 2001, 2006, 2011 and 2016. These products provide spatially explicit and reliable information on the Nation's land cover and land cover change. To continue the legacy of NLCD and further establish a long-term monitoring capability for the Nation's land resources, the USGS designed a new generation of NLCD products released in 2016. This design continues in 2019 and aims to provide innovative, consistent, and robust methodologies for production of a multi-temporal land cover and land cover change database from 2001 to 2019 at 2-3-year intervals. Comprehensive research was conducted and resulted in processes in streamlined processes for integrating specialized MRLC partner data along with numerous newly available dataset, assembling and preprocessing Landsat imagery and geospatial ancillary datasets; a multi-source integrated training data development and machine learning based land cover classifications; a temporally, spectrally, and spatially integrated land cover change analysis strategy; a hierarchical theme-based post-classification and integration protocol for generating land cover and change products; a continuous fields biophysical parameters modeling method; and an automated operational system for the NLCD 2019 production. These processes resulted in a five percent increase in accuracy from the 2011 product for an overall Level II & I Overall accuracy (OA) 86.4% & 90.6% in the NLCD 2016 release. (Wickham et. al, "Thematic Accuracy assessment of the NLCD 2016 land cover for the conterminous United States", Remote Sensing of Environment, volume 257, May 2021, 112357 https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rse.2021.112357 )

    <br> <b><u>GRIDCERF Composite Data Layer Methodology: </u></b> The composite GRIDCERF wetland raster uses both wetlands categories in the NLCD: Class 90 - Woody Wetlands: areas where forest or shrubland vegetation accounts for greater than 20% of vegetative cover and the soil or substrate is periodically saturated with or covered with water and Class 95 - Emergent Herbaceous Wetlands: Areas where perennial herbaceous vegetation accounts for greater than 80% of vegetative cover and the soil or substrate is periodically saturated with or covered with water. Due to the large size of the NLCD raster, we conducted the following pre-processing steps in a free and open-source GIS (QGIS; https://www.qgis.org/en/site/forusers/download.html): (1) Used the SAGA Resampling tool to aggregate the NLCD 30m data to GRIDCERF 1km resolution. We upscaled using the majority setting where the 1km gridcell would take on the majority grid cell value from the finer resoltuion data. (2) Used the Reclassify by table tool to set values for wetland classes of 90 and 95 to 1 and all other classes to 0. (3) We then used the Polygonize (raster to vector) tool to write a polygonize the 0, 1 grid cells to a shapefile. Following the pre-process steps, we reprojected the data to the NAD 1983 Albers contiguous USA (ESRI:102003) coordinate reference system and rasterized. Any 1km grid cell that is touched by a feature geometry is burned in as part of the final raster. No additional modifications or buffers were applied.

        <br><b><u>Description from Source: </u></b>The purpose of HAPCs is to focus conservation, management, and research efforts on subsets of EFH that are vulnerable to degradation or are especially important ecologically for federally managed fish. The HAPC designation alone does not confer additional protection or restrictions to an area, but helps to focus EFH conservation, management, and research priorities. HAPC designation is a valuable way to acknowledge areas where we have detailed information on ecological function and habitat vulnerability, indicating a greater need for conservation and management. In some instances the Councils and NMFS may develop fishery management measures to conserve the habitat within the HAPC.

        <br><b><u>Description from Source: </u></b>These data represent the location of Danger Zones and Restricted Areas within coastal and marine waters, as outlined by the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) and the Raster Navigational Charts (RNC). The CFR defines a Danger Zone as, "A defined water area (or areas) used for target practice, bombing, rocket firing or other especially hazardous operations, normally for the armed forces. The danger zones may be closed to the public on a full-time or intermittent basis, as stated in the regulations." The CFR defines a Restricted Area as, "A defined water area for the purpose of prohibiting or limiting public access to the area. Restricted areas generally provide security for Government property and/or protection to the public from the risks of damage or injury arising from the Government's use of that area." Other features in this dataset include: Danger Area, Missile Testing Area, Naval Operations Area, Prohibited Area, Restricted Airspace, Test Area, and Torpedo Testing Area. Authoritative information relating to these data may be found in Title 33, Chapter II of the CFR (Part 334).

        <br><b><u>Description from Source: </u></b>Munitions and explosives of concern (MEC) have been deposited on the seabed of the United States Outer Continental Shelf since World War I. The bulk of these munitions have originated from the U.S. Armed Forces while conducting military training exercises, war-time placement, and disposal and dumping activities. Since 1972, ocean disposal of munitions and other pollutants has been banned by the Marine Protection, Research, and Sanctuaries Act. Federal and state efforts to mitigate, map, monitor, and sometimes remove these munitions are ongoing. The term MEC defines a collection of munitions including a) unexploded ordnance, b) discarded military munitions, and c) munition constituents that are present in high enough concentrations to pose an explosive hazard.

        <br><b><u>Description from Source: </u></b>Shipwrecks and obstructions in the ocean have long been a hazard to navigation and construction, and points of interest to archaeologists, recreational divers, fishermen, educators, and explorers. Locating hazardous wrecks and obstructions is part of the ongoing NOAA charting process. The exact position of many wrecks is difficult to determine because of changes in the environment, varied survey methods, and human error. Some wrecks are intentionally placed in the ocean to serve as artificial reefs or for disposal. Others pose a health and environmental threat from their cargo. Ownership and control over wrecks and obstructions is governed by a collection of state and federal regulations, the Abandoned Shipwreck Act, National Historic Preservation Act, and National Marine Sanctuaries Act.

NPS Director's Order #25 states: "Land status maps will be prepared to identify the ownership of the lands within the authorized boundaries of the park unit. These maps, showing ownership and acreage, are the 'official record' of the acreage of Federal and non-federal lands within the park boundaries. While these maps are the official record of the lands and acreage within the unit's authorized boundaries, they are not of survey quality and not intended to be used for survey purposes." As such this data is intended for use as a tool for GIS analysis. It is in no way intended for engineering or legal purposes. The data accuracy is checked against best available sources which may be dated and vary by location. NPS assumes no liability for use of this data. The boundary polygons represent the current legislated boundary of a given NPS unit. NPS does not necessarily have full fee ownership or hold another interest (easement, right of way, etc...) in all parcels contained within this boundary. Equivalently NPS may own or have an interest in parcels outside the legislated boundary of a given unit. In order to obtain complete information about current NPS interests both inside and outside a unit's legislated boundary tract level polygons are also created by NPS Land Resources Division and should be used in conjunction with this boundary data.

    <br> <b><u>GRIDCERF Composite Data Layer Methodology: </u></b> The 100m annnual average wind speed data contains raster data (data source 1) for average wind speeds at 10m, 40m, 60m, 80m, 100m, 120m, 140m, 160m, and 200m for both onshore and offshore areas. To align with current and future utility scale wind farms, only 80m and above data is used. To determine which areas are capable of meeting specific capacity factors for wind generation, the wind power density at the wind turbine rotor elevation must be calculated. Wind power is equal to the turbine efficiency rating * air density * rotor area * wind speed^3 (see, https://www.e-education.psu.edu/emsc297/node/649). Air density varies based on altitude. To estimate the altitude at each location in the CONUS, the elevation at each point is used in conjunction with the hub height of the turbine being evaluated. Only areas capable of generating sufficient wind energy on average across an entire year are deemed suitable. For layers indicating no wind potential, all areas with average wind speed < 4m/s (wind cut-in speed) are excluded. The source data is reprojected to the NAD 1983 Albers contiguous USA (ESRI:102003) coordinate reference system, no other buffers or modifications are applied.

To estimate the altitude at each location in the CONUS, the elevation at each point is used in conjunction with the hub height of the turbine being evaluated. Only areas capable of generating sufficient wind energy on average across an entire year are deemed suitable. For layers indicating no wind potential, all areas with average wind speed < 4m/s (wind cut-in speed) are excluded.

    <br> <b><u>GRIDCERF Composite Data Layer Methodology: </u></b> The 100m annnual average wind speed data contains raster data (data source 1) for average wind speeds at 10m, 40m, 60m, 80m, 100m, 120m, 140m, 160m, and 200m for both onshore and offshore areas. To align with current and future utility scale wind farms, only 80m and above data is used. To determine which areas are capable of meeting specific capacity factors for wind generation, the wind power density at the wind turbine rotor elevation must be calculated. Wind power is equal to the turbine efficiency rating * air density * rotor area * wind speed^3 (see, https://www.e-education.psu.edu/emsc297/node/649). Air density varies based on altitude. To estimate the altitude at each location in the CONUS, the elevation at each point is used in conjunction with the hub height of the turbine being evaluated. Only areas capable of generating sufficient wind energy on average across an entire year are deemed suitable. For layers indicating no wind potential, all areas with average wind speed < 4m/s (wind cut-in speed) are excluded. The source data is reprojected to the NAD 1983 Albers contiguous USA (ESRI:102003) coordinate reference system, no other buffers or modifications are applied.

To align with current and future utility scale wind farms, only 80m and above data is used. To determine which areas are capable of meeting specific capacity factors for wind generation, the wind power density at the wind turbine rotor elevation must be calculated. Wind power is equal to the turbine efficiency rating * air density * rotor area * wind speed^3 (see, https://www.e-education.psu.edu/emsc297/node/649). Air density varies based on altitude. To estimate the altitude at each location in the CONUS, the elevation at each point is used in conjunction with the hub height of the turbine being evaluated. Only areas capable of generating sufficient wind energy on average across an entire year are deemed suitable. For layers indicating no wind potential, all areas with average wind speed < 4m/s (wind cut-in speed) are excluded.

    <br> <b><u>GRIDCERF Composite Data Layer Methodology: </u></b> The 100m annnual average wind speed data contains raster data (data source 1) for average wind speeds at 10m, 40m, 60m, 80m, 100m, 120m, 140m, 160m, and 200m for both onshore and offshore areas. To align with current and future utility scale wind farms, only 80m and above data is used. To determine which areas are capable of meeting specific capacity factors for wind generation, the wind power density at the wind turbine rotor elevation must be calculated. Wind power is equal to the turbine efficiency rating * air density * rotor area * wind speed^3 (see, https://www.e-education.psu.edu/emsc297/node/649). Air density varies based on altitude. To estimate the altitude at each location in the CONUS, the elevation at each point is used in conjunction with the hub height of the turbine being evaluated. Only areas capable of generating sufficient wind energy on average across an entire year are deemed suitable. For layers indicating no wind potential, all areas with average wind speed < 4m/s (wind cut-in speed) are excluded.

These data were derived from the National Elevation Dataset (NED) released in October, 2012, The elevation data shows the terrain at a resolution of 100 meters. The NED is a raster product assembled by the U.S. Geological Survey, designed to provide national elevation data in a seamless form with a consistent datum, elevation unit, and projection.

    <br> <b><u>GRIDCERF Composite Data Layer Methodology: </u></b> The 100m annnual average wind speed data contains raster data (data source 1) for average wind speeds at 10m, 40m, 60m, 80m, 100m, 120m, 140m, 160m, and 200m for both onshore and offshore areas. To align with current and future utility scale wind farms, only 80m and above data is used. To determine which areas are capable of meeting specific capacity factors for wind generation, the wind power density at the wind turbine rotor elevation must be calculated. Wind power is equal to the turbine efficiency rating * air density * rotor area * wind speed^3 (see, https://www.e-education.psu.edu/emsc297/node/649). Air density varies based on altitude. To estimate the altitude at each location in the CONUS, the elevation at each point is used in conjunction with the hub height of the turbine being evaluated. Only areas capable of generating sufficient wind energy on average across an entire year are deemed suitable. For layers indicating no wind potential, all areas with average wind speed < 4m/s (wind cut-in speed) are excluded. The source data is reprojected to the NAD 1983 Albers contiguous USA (ESRI:102003) coordinate reference system, no other buffers or modifications are applied.

Siting nuclear reactors requires specific population-density based metrics. Using a singular grid-cell as a starting point, any circle drawn around that point, up to a 20-mile radius, is excluded as unsuitable if the average population density within that circle is greater than or equal to 500 people per square mile. To avoid offshore areas with population of 0 decreasing the average for coastal areas, offshore areas are considered to have null population and are not included in the average for any circle that includes offshore areas.

    <br> <b><u>GRIDCERF Composite Data Layer Methodology: </u></b> Suitability layers are created for densely populated areas for the indicated socioeconomic pathway and year combination. Siting nuclear reactors requires specific population-density based metrics. Using a singular grid-cell as a starting point, any circle drawn around that point, up to a 20-mile radius, is excluded as unsuitable if the average population density within that circle is greater than or equal to 500 people per square mile. To avoid offshore areas with population of 0 decreasing the average for coastal areas, offshore areas are considered to have null population and are not included in the average for any circle that includes offshore areas.

    <br> <b><u>GRIDCERF Composite Data Layer Methodology: </u></b> Suitability layers are created for densely populated areas for the indicated socioeconomic pathway and year combination. Siting nuclear reactors requires specific population-density based metrics. Using a singular grid-cell as a starting point, any circle drawn around that point, up to a 20-mile radius, is excluded as unsuitable if the average population density within that circle is greater than or equal to 500 people per square mile. To avoid offshore areas with population of 0 decreasing the average for coastal areas, offshore areas are considered to have null population and are not included in the average for any circle that includes offshore areas.

Siting nuclear reactors requires specific population-density based metrics. Using a singular grid-cell as a starting point, any circle drawn around that point, up to a 20-mile radius, is excluded as unsuitable if the average population density within that circle is greater than or equal to 500 people per square mile. To avoid offshore areas with population of 0 decreasing the average for coastal areas, offshore areas are considered to have null population and are not included in the average for any circle that includes offshore areas.

    <br> <b><u>GRIDCERF Composite Data Layer Methodology: </u></b> Suitability layers are created for densely populated areas for the indicated socioeconomic pathway and year combination. Siting nuclear reactors requires specific population-density based metrics. Using a singular grid-cell as a starting point, any circle drawn around that point, up to a 20-mile radius, is excluded as unsuitable if the average population density within that circle is greater than or equal to 500 people per square mile. To avoid offshore areas with population of 0 decreasing the average for coastal areas, offshore areas are considered to have null population and are not included in the average for any circle that includes offshore areas.

        <br><b><u>Description from Source: </u></b>The Navigable Waterway Network Lines dataset is periodically updated by the United States Army Corp of Engineers (USACE) and is part of the U.S. Department of Transportation (USDOT)/Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS) National Transportation Atlas Database (NTAD). The National Waterway Network (Lines) is a comprehensive network database of the Nation's navigable waterways. The dataset covers the 48 contiguous states plus the District of Columbia, Hawaii, Alaska, Puerto Rico and water links between. It consists of a line feature class of the National Waterway Network (NWN), which is based on a route feature class for the NWN update regions (“1” through “7”, as well as the open ocean region “0”) and route event table with linear referencing system measures for NWN links. This dataset is a feature class with associated measures (in miles) that are used for finding distances, locating features, and displaying route event layers. It was exported from this route event layer. The nominal scale of the dataset varies with the source material. The majority of the information is at 1:100,000 with larger scales used in harbor/bay/port areas and smaller scales used in open waters. These data could be used for analytical studies of waterway performance, for compiling commodity flow statistics, and for mapping purposes.

This layer was created by a multi-agency effort including the US Forest Service, National Park Service, Bureau of Land Management and the Fish and Wildlife Service. The spatial data were referenced to the latest High Resolution National Hydrological Data Layer (NHD 1:24,000 Scale or better), published by United States Geological Survey (USGS). Wild rivers are free of dams, generally inaccessible except by trail, and represent vestiges of primitive America. Scenic rivers are free of dams, with shorelines or watersheds still largely primitive and shorelines largely undeveloped, but accessible in places by roads. Recreational rivers are readily accessible by road or railroad, may have some development along their shorelines, and may have been dammed in the past

        <br><b><u>Description from Source: </u></b>When a species is proposed for listing as endangered or threatened under the Endangered Species Act, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service must consider whether there are areas of habitat believed to be essential the species' conservation. Those areas may be proposed for designation as “critical habitat.” Critical habitat is a term defined and used in the Act. It is a specific geographic area(s) that contains features essential for the conservation of a threatened or endangered species and that may require special management and protection. Critical habitat may include an area that is not currently occupied by the species but that will be needed for its recovery. An area is designated as “critical habitat” after the Service publishes a proposed Federal regulation in the Federal Register and receives and considers public comments on the proposal. The final boundaries of the critical habitat are also published in the Federal Register. Critical habitat are areas considered essential for the conservation of a listed species. Federal agencies are required to consult with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service on actions they carry out, fund, or authorize to ensure that their actions will not destroy or adversely modify critical habitat. These areas provide notice to the public and land managers of the importance of these areas to the conservation of a listed species. Special protections and/or restrictions are possible in areas where Federal funding, permits, licenses, authorizations, or actions occur or are required.

        <br><b><u>Description from Source: </u></b>This data is a representation of stream and river water bodies derived from the National Hydrography Dataset (NHD) and is symbolized by flow rate from gauge adjusted values from the USGS Extended Unit Runoff Method(EROM) table. The EROM table contains other mean annual flow/velocity statistics for the NHDFlowline features such as Flow from runoff or Velocity from runoff. Subject matter experts on this data agreed that for the purposes of finding flow discharge rates of cooling water for power plants, the gauge adjusted vales were the ideal empirical values for this study. It should also be noted that the flow rates were originally in Cubic feet per second (cfs) but converted to Gallons per minute (gpm). The geospatial data sets included in NHDPlusV2 are intended to support a variety of water- related applications. They already have been used in an application to develop estimates of mean annual streamflow and velocity for each NHDFlowline feature in the conterminous United States. The results of these analyses are included with the NHDPlusV2 data. A water-quality model developed by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) called SPARROW (Spatially Referenced Regressions on Watershed Attributes), can utilize the NHDPlusV2 network functionality to track the downstream transport of nutrients, sediments, or other substances. NHDPlusV2 water bodies and estimates of streamflow and velocity are used in SPARROW to identify reservoir retention and in-stream loss factors. NHDPlusV2 climatic and land surface attributes can be used in SPARROW to identify potential factors in the delivery of nutrients from the land surface to streams. NHDPlusV2 data is also being used in select areas for a USGS Web-based application, called StreamStats. StreamStats provides tools to interactively select any point in the implemented areas, delineate watersheds, and to obtain streamflow and watershed characteristics for the selected point. NHDPlusV2 has been designed to accommodate many users' needs for future applications. NHDPlusV2 provides the framework and tools necessary to customize the behavior of the network relationships as well as building upon the attribute database, for which the user can assign their own data to the network.

        <br><b><u>Description from Source: </u></b>Seismicity catalogs, GIS shapefiles, gridded seismic hazard curve data, gridded ground motion data, and mapped gridded ground motion values are available for the 2014 National Seismic Hazard Model for the Conterminous U.S. Probabilistic seismic hazard data and maps of the conterminous U.S. for peak ground acceleration (PGA) and 0.2 and 1.0 second spectral acceleration at probability levels of 2 percent in 50 years (annual probability of 0.000404) and 10 percent in 50 years (annual probability of 0.0021), assuming firm rock soil conditions at 760 m/s, are available. Hazard was calculated on a 0.05 degree by 0.05 degree grid, defined by a bounding box encompassing the conterminous U.S. (-125 to -65 degrees longitude west, 24.6 to 50 degrees latitude north). Development of the 2014 National Seismic Hazard Model for the Conterminous U.S. is documented in the USGS Open-File Report 2014-1091 (https://pubs.usgs.gov/of/2014/1091/). This dataset is considered a legacy dataset. The original dataset was uploaded to the USGS website at the time of publication of the seismic hazard model (2014) but was later moved over the the USGS ScienceBase Catalog (2019). The original dataset was assumed to be complete and accurate, but may contain inconsistencies when compared to more recent, actively maintained datasets. NOTE: In 2018, additional period and site class maps were calculated for the 2014 NSHM. For additional period and site class maps and data, please see https://doi.org/10.5066/P9I6BPX5, documented in USGS Open-File Report 2018-1111 (https://doi.org/10.3133/ofr20181111).

    <h3> US Geological Survey Protected Areas Database Class 1 & 2 Additions </h3>
    <b><u>GRIDCERF Layer Name:</u></b> gridcerf_usgs_padus_class_1_to_2_conus_additions.tif 
    <br> <br><b><u>Source Data 1:</u></b>
        <br><ol><b><u>Source Data Title: </u></b>Protected Areas Database of the United States (PAD-US) 3.0 (ver. 2.0, March 2023)
        <br><b><u>Description from Source: </u></b>The USGS Protected Areas Database of the United States (PAD-US) is the nation's inventory of protected areas, including public land and voluntarily provided private protected areas, identified as an A-16 National Geospatial Data Asset in the Cadastre Theme ( https://ngda-cadastre-geoplatform.hub.arcgis.com/ ). The PAD-US is an ongoing project with several published versions of a spatial database including areas dedicated to the preservation of biological diversity, and other natural (including extraction), recreational, or cultural uses, managed for these purposes through legal or other effective means. The database was originally designed to support biodiversity assessments; however, its scope expanded in recent years to include all open space public and nonprofit lands and waters. Most are public lands owned in fee (the owner of the property has full and irrevocable ownership of the land); however, permanent and long-term easements, leases, agreements, Congressional (e.g. 'Wilderness Area'), Executive (e.g. 'National Monument'), and administrative designations (e.g. 'Area of Critical Environmental Concern') documented in agency management plans are also included. The PAD-US strives to be a complete inventory of U.S. public land and other protected areas, compiling best available data provided by managing agencies and organizations. The PAD-US geodatabase maps and describes areas using thirty-six attributes and five separate feature classes representing the U.S. protected areas network: Fee (ownership parcels), Designation, Easement, Marine, Proclamation and Other Planning Boundaries. An additional Combined feature class includes the full PAD-US inventory to support data management, queries, web mapping services, and analyses. The Feature Class (FeatClass) field in the Combined layer allows users to extract data types as needed. A Federal Data Reference file geodatabase lookup table (ADUS3_0Combined_Federal_Data_References) facilitates the extraction of authoritative federal data provided or recommended by managing agencies from the Combined PAD-US inventory. This PAD-US Version 3.0 dataset includes a variety of updates from the previous Version 2.1 dataset (USGS, 2020, https://doi.org/10.5066/P92QM3NT ), achieving goals to: 1) Annually update and improve spatial data representing the federal estate for PAD-US applications; 2) Update state and local lands data as state data-steward and PAD-US Team resources allow; and 3) Automate data translation efforts to increase PAD-US update efficiency. The following list summarizes the integration of best available spatial data to ensure public lands and other protected areas from all jurisdictions are represented in the PAD-US (other data were transferred from PAD-US 2.1). Federal updates - The USGS remains committed to updating federal fee owned lands data and major designation changes in annual PAD-US updates, where authoritative data provided directly by managing agencies are available or alternative data sources are recommended. The following is a list of updates or revisions associated with the federal estate: 1) Major update of the Federal estate (fee ownership parcels, easement interest, and management designations where available), including authoritative data from 8 agencies: Bureau of Land Management (BLM), U.S. Census Bureau (Census Bureau), Department of Defense (DOD), U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS), National Park Service (NPS), Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS), U.S. Forest Service (USFS), and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). The federal theme in PAD-US is developed in close collaboration with the Federal Geographic Data Committee (FGDC) Federal Lands Working Group (FLWG, https://ngda-gov-units-geoplatform.hub.arcgis.com/pages/federal-lands-workgroup ). 2) Improved the representation (boundaries and attributes) of the National Park Service, U.S. Forest Service, Bureau of Land Management, and U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service lands, in collaboration with agency data-stewards, in response to feedback from the PAD-US Team and stakeholders. 3) Added a Federal Data Reference file geodatabase lookup table (PADUS3_0Combined_Federal_Data_References) to the PAD-US 3.0 geodatabase to facilitate the extraction (by Data Provider, Dataset Name, and/or Aggregator Source) of authoritative data provided directly (or recommended) by federal managing agencies from the full PAD-US inventory. A summary of the number of records (Frequency) and calculated GIS Acres (vs Documented Acres) associated with features provided by each Aggregator Source is included; however, the number of records may vary from source data as the "State Name" standard is applied to national files. The Feature Class (FeatClass) field in the table and geodatabase describe the data type to highlight overlapping features in the full inventory (e.g. Designation features often overlap Fee features) and to assist users in building queries for applications as needed. 4) Scripted the translation of the Department of Defense, Census Bureau, and Natural Resource Conservation Service source data into the PAD-US format to increase update efficiency. 5) Revised conservation measures (GAP Status Code, IUCN Category) to more accurately represent protected and conserved areas. For example, Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) Waterfowl Production Area Wetland Easements changed from GAP Status Code 2 to 4 as spatial data currently represents the complete parcel (about 10.54 million acres primarily in North Dakota and South Dakota). Only aliquot parts of these parcels are documented under wetland easement (1.64 million acres). These acreages are provided by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and are referenced in the PAD-US geodatabase Easement feature class 'Comments' field. State updates - The USGS is committed to building capacity in the state data-steward network and the PAD-US Team to increase the frequency of state land updates, as resources allow. The USGS supported efforts to significantly increase state inventory completeness with the integration of local parks data in the PAD-US 2.1, and developed a state-to-PAD-US data translation script during PAD-US 3.0 development to pilot in future updates. Additional efforts are in progress to support the technical and organizational strategies needed to increase the frequency of state updates. The PAD-US 3.0 included major updates to the following three states: 1) California - added or updated state, regional, local, and nonprofit lands data from the California Protected Areas Database (CPAD), managed by GreenInfo Network, and integrated conservation and recreation measure changes following review coordinated by the data-steward with state managing agencies. Developed a data translation Python script (see Process Step 2 Source Data Documentation) in collaboration with the data-steward to increase the accuracy and efficiency of future PAD-US updates from CPAD. 2) Virginia - added or updated state, local, and nonprofit protected areas data (and removed legacy data) from the Virginia Conservation Lands Database, provided by the Virginia Department of Conservation and Recreation's Natural Heritage Program, and integrated conservation and recreation measure changes following review by the data-steward. 3) West Virginia - added or updated state, local, and nonprofit protected areas data provided by the West Virginia University, GIS Technical Center. For more information regarding the PAD-US dataset please visit, https://www.usgs.gov/programs/gap-analysis-project/science/protected-areas. For more information about data aggregation please review the PAD-US Data Manual available at https://www.usgs.gov/programs/gap-analysis-project/pad-us-data-manual. A version history of PAD-US updates is summarized below (See https://www.usgs.gov/programs/gap-analysis-project/pad-us-data-history for more information): 1) First posted - April 2009 (Version 1.0 - available from the PAD-US: Team pad-us@usgs.gov). 2) Revised - May 2010 (Version 1.1 - available from the PAD-US: Team pad-us@usgs.gov). 3) Revised - April 2011 (Version 1.2 - available from the PAD-US: Team pad-us@usgs.gov). 4) Revised - November 2012 (Version 1.3) https://doi.org/10.5066/F79Z92XD 5) Revised - May 2016 (Version 1.4) https://doi.org/10.5066/F7G73BSZ 6) Revised - September 2018 (Version 2.0) https://doi.org/10.5066/P955KPLE 7) Revised - September 2020 (Version 2.1) https://doi.org/10.5066/P92QM3NT 8) Revised - January 2022 (Version 3.0) https://doi.org/10.5066/P9Q9LQ4B Comparing protected area trends between PAD-US versions is not recommended without consultation with USGS as many changes reflect improvements to agency and organization GIS systems, or conservation and recreation measure classification, rather than actual changes in protected area acquisition on the ground.

    <br> <b><u>GRIDCERF Composite Data Layer Methodology: </u></b> The composite GRIDCERF USGS PAD layer includes status class 1 and 2 that is not already excluded in other common layers: (1) Class 1 - managed for biodiversity - disturbance events proceed or are mimicked and (2) Class 2 - managed for biodiversity - disturbance events suppressed. The PADUS dataset includes many areas that are separately included in GRIDCERF data layers (e.g., national parks, national monuments). To avoid significant correlation across GRIDCERF files, the combined information of exluded areas already covered in the other common layers is excluded from the composite PADUS layer. Protected areas that are in addition to the ones separately captured, are therefore represented by this layer. To create the composite PADUS layer, the PADUS source data is reprojected to the NAD 1983 Albers contiguous USA (ESRI:102003) coordinate reference system and rasterized. Any 1km grid cell that is touched by a feature geometry is burned in as part of the final raster.

    <br> <b><u>GRIDCERF Composite Data Layer Methodology: </u></b> The 100m annnual average wind speed data contains raster data (data source 1) for average wind speeds at 10m, 40m, 60m, 80m, 100m, 120m, 140m, 160m, and 200m for both onshore and offshore areas. To align with current and future utility scale wind farms, only 80m and above data is used.  For areas indicating no wind potential, all areas with average wind speed < 4m/s (wind cut-in speed) are excluded. The source data is reprojected to the NAD 1983 Albers contiguous USA (ESRI:102003) coordinate reference system, no other buffers or modifications are applied.
